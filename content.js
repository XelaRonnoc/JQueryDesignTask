        title: "World Building Intro",
        paragraph: `World building is an integral part of creating any piece of fiction. Regardless of if it is fantasy or Sci-fi or even Historical fiction it is essential to establish to the audience the social, physical and political environment of the world to some extent in order to allow the audience to become invested in your story and allow them to place themselves within it. If your audience comes away from your story imagining themselves in the world you have constructed and playing a role within it then this is a good sign you have built an interesting world. Through this site we will discuss not only what a good world builder takes into account when building their world but also how they convey this information and exposition to the audience.`,

        title: "Deep Not Broad",
        paragraph: `When world building it is easy to fall into the trap of trying to do too much, have too many spells, too many alien races, too many factions, too many planets and it all becomes very difficult for the audience to establish a mental picture of especially since the more things you add to the world the less time you have to go into depth with these things. 

        Imagine adding elements (races, spells, countries, technologies) is like adding surface area to an object. Eventually that object will fall victim to the Square Cube Law as the surface area of the animal increases linearly the volume increases exponentially. This is what happens when you add more elements to your world. In order to flesh out each element you must dive into much greater depths and branching results from that one element  in order to make it feel like an integral part of the world. For example if you add nanite healing technology, you need to consider all the potential applications of that technology so as to make it feel internally realistic (follows the rules established within the world) to the world. Would this technology be used to create a machine virus that instead of healing cells destroys them? Does it cause overpopulation as nobody dies anymore? These questions must be answered for the world to feel real. Therefore the more of these elements you add the more questions are asked and as such it massively increases the amount of depth that needs to be provided.

        With this in mind it is often the best approach to focus on a few core/key elements to your fictional world and deeply flesh out implications of these elements on the world. This will make your job as a world builder easier and provide the most bang for buck in terms of audience immersion.

        title: "Creativity and Limitations",
        paragraph: `This concept is similar to the above one in the sense that limiting what the characters within the world have access to can make for much much more interesting conflicts/challenges and emergent behaviors within your world. This really shows itself when talking about characters. If you have a magic system that is able to do everything and costs nothing then there is very little challenge to the characters in your world and all their solutions to problems can be the most obvious and boring ones possible as their power is so immense.However a more limited magic system such as bending within the Avatar:the last air bender series forces characters to only utilize the tools they have at their disposal say water benders learning how to bend the water in a human's body to escape their predicament. This allows you to create much more interesting stories and challenges within your world for your characters to overcome.`,

        title: "Exposition",
        paragraph: `Contrary to popular belief, people love expository documentaries that are effectively non-fiction exposition about the real world and lots of people find great enjoyment in being told how things work so why shouldn’t the audience of your work of fiction not enjoy the same? 

        The two main aspects to making the audience enjoy your exposition is the What and the How and one thing you must never do. If what you're expositing about is interesting in and of itself that is always going to be more enjoyable for an audience than if not, and if you have taken into account the above two suggestions your world should be interesting as it is. The how can be just as important however and within this there are two main methods to make it interesting to the audience. The first is to actually make the exposition the payoff of the story. This is what many detectives and who done it stories do, there is almost always a scene that is completely exposition where the detective goes through how they have figured out who in fact has done it. This is nearly entirely exposition; however if the clues and twists and mystery up to this point have been a good story not only will the audience tolerate the exposition but they will actively want it. The second method is to not even let the audience know they are being exposited to. This is where effective world building can really shine. This can be done through the environment and the people in it, how they talk, what they wear, the architecture, who do they work for, what facilities exist, do they have cybernetic implants, are there lots of security/guards? These descriptions of the environment can tell the audience massive amounts of information about the world, it’s current situation, the politics, and the people within it without ever explicitly having to tell the audience anything about why these things exist as through their existence they provide their own explanation and explain why other things within this world are the way they are. This is simply an extension of the idea of show don’t tell when it comes to world building and exposition.

        title: "A Brief Example",
        paragraph: `As an example we will take a look at a more modern fantasy setting with one more deeply thought out element. A healing spell that only some people are able to learn and master but is able to heal almost any wound even able to revive those who are dead however it drains the user of their energy and if they are not careful can cause parts of their bod/themselves to necrotize and die as they run out of energy to maintain the spell and their body. What effect does this have on our world? Would duels to the death become more commonplace as it was possible for an experienced healer to just revive the loser from the dead? Would murders become more brutal as to prevent any chance of the victim from being revived and providing evidence against the person who did it? Would technology and understanding of biology stagnate as there was no need to learn more about germs or diseases as they can all be healed by a healer. Would the services of the healer be very expensive like private medical care is today? Would band-aids still be a thing or does the school nurse just heal any cuts and scrapes children might get at school? Do extreme sports become more prevalent as the risk or real death is so much less likely? To go into a bit of weirdness, do people develop new kinks regarding dying and being brought back to life? Do certain religions claim this as evidence of their god? Do they decry it as witchcraft and try to hunt down healers or ban their use? This is by no means an exhaustive list or even an in depth example, but you can see from this alone the impacts of just one spell that only some people can use on a world and you can see why it is important not to stretch yourself too thin with the elements in your story.`,

        title: "Final Thoughts",
        paragraph: `Throughout this article we have discussed some important tips and concepts to keep in mind when building a fictional world of your own as well as how to present this to your audience. We have discussed the concept of deeper is better than broader as it relates to increasing audience immersion as well as decreasing the likelihood of internally unrealistic scenarios occurring within your world and provided an example of how just one additional element can  make massive changes to a world. We have further explored the idea that less can be more when it comes to making interesting worlds and characters where one well implemented spell or system can allow for much greater creativity and interest than a hundred. Finally we have discussed how you can go about conveying this world building through to your audience and how you can get them to actually enjoy it or seamlessly integrate it into the world in such a way that the audience is never even aware that they are being exposed to. If you are able to implement some of these tips into your world building whether it be for a tabletop narrative campaign, a book, a movie, or a game you will surely be starting with the right foot forward.`,
